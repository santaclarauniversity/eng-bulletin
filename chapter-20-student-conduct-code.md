# Chapter 18: Student Conduct Code

## Statement Of Responsibilities And Standards Of Conduct

All members of the University community have a strong responsibility to protect and maintain an academic climate in which the fundamental freedom to learn can be enjoyed by all and where the rights and well-being of all members of the community are protected. To this end, certain basic regulations and policies have been developed to govern the conduct of all students as members of the University community. Copies of the Student Handbook, which includes the Student Conduct Code, and information about the policies and procedures regarding the student judicial system are available from the Office of Student Life and at [www.scu.edu/osl/student-conduct/](http://www.scu.edu/osl/student-conduct/).

The goal of Santa Clara University is to provide students with a general education so that they will acquire knowledge, skill, and wisdom to deal with and contribute to contemporary society in constructive ways. As an institution of higher education rooted in the Jesuit tradition, the University is committed to creating and sustaining an environment that facilitates not only academic development but also the personal and spiritual development of its members. This commitment of the University encourages the greatest possible degree of freedom for individual choice and expression, with the expectation that individual members of the community will:

* Be honest.
* Demonstrate self-respect.
* Demonstrate respect for others.
* Demonstrate respect for the law and University policies, procedures, and standards; their administration; and the process for changing those laws, policies, procedures, and standards. 

In keeping with this commitment, this Statement of Responsibilities and Standards of Conduct and related policies and procedures have been formulated to guarantee each student’s freedom to learn and to protect the fundamental rights of others. There can be no rights and freedoms if all who claim them do not recognize and respect the same rights and freedoms for others. In addition to the laws of the nation, the State of California, and the local community, the University administration has established policies, procedures, and standards deemed necessary to achieve its objectives as a Catholic, Jesuit university.

All members of the Santa Clara community are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that is consistent with the goals of the institution and to demonstrate respect for self, others, and their property. Students living off campus are members of this community, and as such are representatives to the community at large. In this regard, students living off campus maintain an equal measure of accountability to the values and expectations of all members of this community as identified in the Student Conduct Code.

Whether living in or traversing through the neighborhood, or parking in the street, students are expected to adhere to the same high standards of conduct and behavior that are consistent with the students’ developing role as responsible and accountable citizens, and that reflect well upon the Santa Clara University community.

All members of the University community have a strong responsibility to protect and maintain an academic climate in which the fundamental freedom to learn can be enjoyed by all and where the rights and well-being of all members of the community are protected. The University reserves the right to review student conduct that occurs on and off campus when such behavior is inconsistent with this expectation and the Student Conduct Code. The following acts subject students to disciplinary action:

1. Engaging in any form of academic dishonesty, such as plagiarism \(representing the work or ideas of others as one’s own without giving proper acknowledgment\), cheating \(e.g., copying the work of another person, falsifying laboratory data, sabotaging the work of others\), and other acts generally understood to be dishonest by faculty or students in an academic context.

Students who are alleged to have violated the Student Conduct Code may be subject to disciplinary action and, if applicable, may also be subject to criminal prosecution.

## Judicial Records Policy

When the Office of Student Life receives the report, the assistant dean will meet with the student to discuss the relevance of the violation to the Student Conduct Code. Whether further judicial sanctions are applied or not, the report of academic dishonesty will remain on file in the Office of Student Life for the remainder of the student's enrollment at Santa Clara University. The student involved has the right to include a statement as part of these files.

If it is ruled that the student committed an academic integrity violation, the Office of Student Life will administer a judicial sanction that would range from a letter of warning to expulsion from the University. The severity of the judicial sanction depends on the severity of the circumstances, including the student's judicial history and previous academic integrity violations.

## Allegations Outside a Course

If the allegation involves a situation outside the context of a course, resolution begins with the Office of Student Life. The assistant dean will confer with all parties concerned. After hearing all evidence and conducting further investigation as needed, the assistant dean will either hear the case or refer it to a judicial board in accordance with the University Judicial Process. The outcome of the hearing will be communicated to those involved.

## Student Conduct Records Policy 

The Office of Student Life maintains a hard copy file and a digital record of a student’s conduct history. Conduct records are educational records, and are thereby subject to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act \(FERPA\) and the University’s Student Records Policy.

The conduct record is confidential and is only shared internally with University officials, in instances when the student grants permission to release the record, or there is what FERPA defines “an educational need to know” basis for the request. The conduct record is maintained throughout the student’s enrollment and thereafter, as indicated below. A student’s conduct record will only be released from the hard copy file to a person or party external to the University, if the student has granted permission, where the disclosure of the record is permissible under the provisions of FERPA, or where the University is required to do so by law. The digital copy of the conduct record will only be released to an external person or party where the University is required to do so by law. 

## Retention of Hard Copy of Conduct Records 

1. The hard copy file of a student’s entire conduct history is kept for a minimum of one \(1\) academic year beyond the academic year in which the date of the last violation of the Student Conduct Code occurred. When a student commits a violation of academic integrity, the hard copy file is retained for the remainder of a student’s academic career.
2. The files of any student who has received one or more of the following sanctions will be maintained for three \(3\) academic years beyond the academic year in which the student’s tenure in his/her current degree program at the University has ended:
   1. Removal from University housing 
   2. Disciplinary probation 
   3. Deferred suspension
   4. Suspension
3. The conduct record of a student who has been expelled will be maintained for seven \(7\) years beyond the academic year in which the student’s tenure at the University has ended

_**The University reserves the right to change this policy at any time at its sole discretion.**_
