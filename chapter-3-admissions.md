## Program Details

### B.S./M.S. 5 Year Program

* Automatic admission into the five-year program is based on a minimum GPA of 3.0 in the major. Upon notification of acceptance into the B.S./M.S. program, students may begin taking graduate-level courses in their senior year and a maximum of 20 units can be transferred into the graduate program.

### Open University 

* The Department of Computer Science and Engineering will not be accepting applications for Open University.
* For those who want to update their skills and learn new technologies without the commitment of earning a graduate degree, Open University allows students to enroll in graduate-level classes. 
* If students wish to apply to a degree program at a later date, they must follow the same procedure and submit the same supporting documentation required of degree-seeking applicants. A maximum of 16 units may apply toward the degree if the courses are in the same discipline to which the student is accepted. The general GRE test requirement for admission to the master’s degree program will be waived if the student has completed a set of required courses in the department to which they are applying and has earned a GPA of 3.5 or higher. A list of these courses can be found on the Graduate Engineering website:[ www.scu.edu/engineering/academic-programs/waiving-the-gre/](http://www.scu.edu/engineering/academic-programs/waiving-the-gre/)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note 1: Santa Clara University does not issue F-1 visas to applicants who wish to enter directly into this program. 

Note 2: Open University students are not eligible to enroll in undergraduate classes.
{% endhint %}

### Certificate Programs

* Depending on the certificate, students will complete 16-18 units of coursework. Applicants for admission to the certificate programs must submit the following materials:
* Also please note that GRE and TOEFL scores are not required for admission. Certificate programs are not appropriate for international students, who must pursue full-time study. All certificate units in the discipline may be applied toward a master’s degree. Students who wish to pursue such a degree must submit a separate online application and satisfy all normal admission requirements. The application fee will be waived for currently enrolled certificate students. The general GRE and TOEFL test requirement for graduate admission to the master’s degree will be waived for students who complete a certificate with a GPA of 3.5 or higher.

### Master's Program 

* Note: Students applying to the M.S. program in Applied Mathematics, and Mechanical Engineering may petition to waive the GRE requirement by completing the Petition to Waive GRE Requirement form. However, applicants must be aware that there is no guarantee that the waiver will be granted. The Department of Computer Science and Engineering DOES NOT accept GRE waiver.
* This option is also available to applicants for the Engineering Management Program who have two or more years of working experience in the U.S. These students will also complete the Petition to Waive GRE Requirement form, as indicated above.
* The GRE waiver option is also available to applicants for the Engineering Management Program who have two or more years of working experience in the U.S. These students will also complete the Petition to Waive GRE Requirement form, as indicated above.

### Ph.D. and Engineer’s Degrees

Ph.D. and Engineer’s degrees are offered in the Departments of Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. 

### Admission Deferrals

Any student who has been admitted and made a deposit to a degree program and wishes to defer their admission for one year must submit a request, in writing, to the Engineering Graduate Programs Admissions Office prior to the beginning of the quarter.
